# Distributed Bridge decisions

Only consequential decisions. Architecture contracts for standalone Bridge stay in
`docs/llm-bridge/architecture.md`.

## D1 Authoritative owners (REPO-002, QUAL-001)

Provider selection, rotation and retries stay in `ralph_robin`/`scheduler`;
capacity in `capacity`/`routes`/`usage`; mission and task transitions, durable
commands, events and evidence in `bridge_store`; controller, verification,
process ownership and recovery in `bridge_runtime`; tmux station ownership in
`terminal`. The coordinator and worker service add transport and projection only
and call these through the command layer. Consequence: no Rust re-implementation
of any of these rules.

## D2 Typed command layer (ARCH-005, CLI-001, WORK-006)

`llm_tools/bridge_commands.py` declares each shared operation once
(`OperationSpec`: stable ID such as `mission.pause`, typed `Param`s, handler).
Handlers call the existing implementations in `bridge.py` and the store.
`dispatch()` raises domain exceptions so the local CLI keeps its messages and
exit codes; `execute()` returns a `CommandResult` envelope with outcome
`ok|accepted|applied|rejected|failed|uncertain` and a stable error code for
transports. A mutating request's `request_id` becomes the durable
`commands.id`, so a duplicate delivery returns the stored outcome. The apply
step re-reads the command status after taking the SQLite write lock, so two
concurrent deliveries of one ID cannot both apply the effect. An unexpected
exception during a mutation is reported as `uncertain`, never as `failed`.

## D3 Target selection (CLI-003, CLI-005)

`--target NAME` is a leading global option removed before argparse, so every
existing command line is unchanged. `local` (or no option) runs in-process.
Any other name fails with exit 2 until it resolves through a configured
coordinator; there is no fallback to local execution.
